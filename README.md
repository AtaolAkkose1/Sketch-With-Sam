# Sketch-With-Sam
I made a project like Microsoft Paint named as 'Sketch With Sam' in Python by Tkinter...In this project, I made a total of 10 shapes, but some of that shape can produce multipe shapes with also the same shape in other directions...So that shapes are able to produce other shapes...Even In this project, I also include a screenshot option. I also provide cut, copy, paste, undo functionality with shortcut key support. Anybody can draw here and can save their own picture for future reference...Even anyone can take any other photo in that and can use it with another purpose. Tools present under the "Tools Collection" are very useful for smooth work.....This is one of my best projects.
